# Advent of FPGA 2025
Advent of Code puzzles, solved in Hardware, with love.

This repo contains my attempts at solving Advent of Code 2025 problems in HDL. All works are my own
unless otherwise stated (this will be clearly stated in file headers and readmes where possible).

Some ideas for solving puzzles my come from [my attempts at solving these problems in software](https://github.com/rates37/aoc-2025).
